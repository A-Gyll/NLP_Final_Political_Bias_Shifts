wPETy8zTzWY,"FLAMMBOYANT TONY HINCHCLIFFE, A DEMOCRATIC PARTY TROJAN HORSE: You may want to copy and paste my comment here to your Microsoft Word documents because YouTube or one of the federal intelligence agencies that Harris has weaponized, today removed these same comments I made about Hinchcliffe working secretly for the democrats against Trump. My information was based on a confidential source close to Tony Hinchcliffe who became aware of what really occurred last Monday night at Madison Square Garden at Trump‚Äôs rally. Hinchcliffe‚Äôs racist act was a set-up, designed by Nancy Pelosi in an effort to sabotage Trump‚Äôs campaign at the last hour of this election. Kamala Harris, Pelosi and Obama and the Clintons were upset at Puerto Rican and Latino voters who they counted on to support Kamala Harris but recent polls showed these voters were divided with many of them leaning toward Donald Trump. Nancy Pelosi felt something big was needed; something inflammatory, in an effort to quickly alter the Latino perception of Trump for the worse and make Puerto Rican and Hispanic voters suddenly feel as though Trump has betrayed them, that he has viewed them as being nothing more than garbage, etc. Pelosi felt that they, those in charge of Kamala Harris‚Äôs campaign, had to make ‚Äúsomething happen‚Äù, something like a controversy that was born out of racism. Confidential sources close to Hinchcliffe have said they are not shocked to learn Hinchcliffe accepted a deal from Pelosi to bash Puerto Ricans at Trumps‚Äô rally. They said, for the right amount of money, Hinchcliffe would have done anything. Friends of Hinchcliffe said he has been gloating with pride ever since the night of the rally when he disgraced Trump with his remarks. A good friend of Hinchcliffe told me it was Nancy Pelosi's scheme all along, to bribe Hinchcliffe whom she knew was hired to be the opening speaker at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. According to a close friend of Hinchcliffe; who spoke on the condition their identity would not be revealed, the fiasco at Trump's rally caused by Hinchcliffe was, in reality, a 'black operation'. Among the spy masters who control the world‚Äôs intelligence agencies, black operations are also known as 'psy ops', or psychological operations. Such contrived psy ops programs are aimed at causing an immediate false perception in connection with a social or political injustice, demanding an immediate response by the perceived targeted community. In this case, Puerto Ricans and Latinos immediately felt a sense of betrayal on the part of Trump, based on Hinchcliffe's cruel brand of unfunny but insulting remarks, which cannot even be called, humor. Especially when Hinchcliffe was forced to laugh at his own ‚Äòjokes‚Äô because few others did. Pelosi learned Hinchcliffe's career has taken a severe downturn in recent years because of his racist form of humor, which has resulted in derailing his career with comedy clubs and TV shows cancelling his appearances and Hinchcliffe's inability now to find work in Hollywood which has disowned him. With nowhere to turn to financially, Hinchcliffe decided to accept Pelosi's generous financial offer through a third party middleman, a bagman, who gave Hinchcliffe a down payment for his services. His 'services' was to include in his act at Trump's rally, a racist rant, aimed against Puerto Ricans, mostly, in an effort to make them suddenly feel as if Trump does not care about them and other Hispanic groups. Pelosi's plan worked like a charm as Hinchcliffe followed her script and said the insults she wanted him to say. According to a confidential source I spoke to, Obama, Kamala Harris, the Clintons and a few high ranking democrats of the DNC aided and abetted Pelosi, making suggestions and offering advice. The bribe money that was paid to Hinchcliffe will allow him to live very comfortably for the rest of his life. He has since received the second and final installment of that bribe money, now that the rally is over and done with and much to Nancy Pelosi's amusement, Donald Trump's popularity among Puerto Rican and Latino/Hispanic voters has taken a big hit, falling off sharply thanks to Tony Hinchcliffe's betrayal of Trump. Insiders are saying Hinchcliffe is apolitical himself and does not vote and does not consider himself to be a Democrat or Republican. Hinchcliffe's friend, who insists on remaining anonymous, stated that since the rally ended, all the resulting controversy surrounding Hinchcliffe's anti-Puerto Rican comments has only served to inflate Hinchcliffe's already huge ego. The friend said Hinchcliffe is the ultimate cynical and sarcastic narcissist who has no regard for the feelings of people and could care less about what Trump thinks about him. Confidential sources are saying Hinchcliffe has been gloating with pride ever since his racist rants against Puerto Ricans and migrants at Trump's rally last Monday night. The resulting firestorm of controversy has given Hinchcliffe a level of infamy he previously lacked and Hinchcliffe now feels as if this newfound notoriety will result in more comedy club dates for him and TV show bookings but entertainment experts feel the opposite, claiming Hinchcliffe's career has suffered a death blow by his Madison Square Garden act of hatred against the Hispanic race. Friends of Hinchcliffe who requested to remain anonymous stated the villain in this case was not Donald Trump but rather, Nancy Pelosi, Barak Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris who all offered advice and directives to Hinchcliffe through an intermediary who made the payoffs to Hinchcliffe. The sources are saying the amount may be in the millions of dollars. He said Hinchcliffe has thus far declined to say where he has deposited the bribe money Pelosi and Harris paid him to ruin Trump's rally but sources close to Hinchcliffe are saying they believe he now has a Swiss bank account or possibly has opened a secret bank account in an offshore financial institution in the Bahamas. So, this was essentially the report I put out there on YouTube but Hinchcliffe or others have been successful in having my comments removed from YouTube.

wPETy8zTzWY,"<a href="" The comedian was not calling the people of Port Rico garbage. But he's referring to the Garbage issue they are having and limited aid from the Democratic government. Puerto Rico faces a significant waste management crisis, with several contributing factors: (but in poor taste.) Limited Landfill Capacity: The island has limited space for landfills, and many are nearing capacity. About 29 landfills currently exist on the island, but more than half are operating under EPA violations. Some may close within a few years, leading to reduced disposal options. Insufficient Waste Processing and Recycling: Only about 15% of Puerto Rico‚Äôs waste is recycled, well below the rates in the U.S. This low recycling rate means that a larger amount of waste goes directly to landfills. Illegal Dumping: Due to landfill limitations and collection inefficiencies, illegal dumping has become common. This creates environmental hazards, pollutes natural resources, and affects public health, particularly as waste accumulates in rivers, forests, and along roadsides. Natural Disaster Debris: Hurricanes, particularly Hurricane Maria in 2017, left Puerto Rico with vast amounts of debris and waste, adding significant strain to the already limited landfill capacity and waste management systems. Cleanup and waste disposal from such events have been slow. Inconsistent Waste Collection: Waste collection can be unreliable, particularly in rural areas, due to insufficient resources, lack of funding, and organizational challenges. This issue exacerbates the accumulation of garbage and illegal dumping. Financial Constraints: Puerto Rico‚Äôs ongoing debt crisis impacts public funding for waste management infrastructure, making it difficult to invest in more sustainable systems like recycling facilities, composting, or waste-to-energy plants. Environmental and Health Concerns: The accumulation of garbage in landfills and illegal sites contributes to air and water pollution. Decomposing waste emits harmful gases, and leachate (liquid runoff) from landfills risks contaminating soil and groundwater.",@sgfx,2024-10-31

The physical island itself is having a major garbage problem. It is a small island and already has 6 landfills overflowing with garbage and the beaches are covered with garbage some left over from their last hurricane. They have asked the government to either aid in removing the garbage from the island or allow them to burn it which has been refused. Remember also that there is no recycling there also and not only is a lot of garbage generated but there is no room on the island for even 1 more landfill. Instead of directing the comedians comment to the garbage problem that in part Biden/ Harris have created the left media turned it into it being an insult to the Puerto Rican voters.

She only sees her immediate potential electoral benefits, she does not care about the disastrous effect her statement could generate ! Shame on her ! She does that because she can't defend her political plan, she doesn't have any so she never answer the questions that have been asked her in her interviews, prefering talking the same BS about the so-called middle-class she would come from (I don't think she's from a middle-class at all) and insult Trump in the most violent and wrong ways ! That way, everybody will focus on anything but her actual plan ! Plus, she hates us (Jews) ! Se did not come to the Congress to listen to the Israeli Prime Minister and as I learned from the youtube channel of Aaron Cohen, she and Biden have leaked the Israeli plans for the conter-attack against the IRGC in Iran... The documents have been leaked and Israel only gave them to the Biden-Harris administration ! That's a huge betrayal, but we (Israel) know how to create a new strategy against the IRGC, but once more, the Biden-Harris administration, shamefully betrayed us (the Jewish people and the Israeli State), we won't forget and sooner or later, they will face prosecutions for what they did to us The arms embargo to an ally in the most critical moment and the leak of top secret documents from that ally !

Their military operations have killed thousands of innocent civilians, including children. And for you to act like October 7th was the beginning of the conflict is just ignorant. The reality is, Israel has been oppressing Palestinians for decades, ever since 1948 when they forcibly displaced Palestinians from their homes. They continue to hold Palestinians hostage, restrict their movement, and control their access to basic resources like food, water, and medical supplies. If you‚Äôre going to talk about this issue, at least have the decency to acknowledge the atrocities Israel has committed and stop spreading lies to make them look like victims when there the ones that started this whole mess,The conflict between Israel and Lebanon dates back to 1982 when Israel invaded southern Lebanon to push out the PLO, sparking ongoing hostilities with Hezbollah. Israel‚Äôs occupation fueled resistance, leading to decades of tension. In 2024, this conflict reignited, causing harm not just to Hezbollah fighters but also to many innocent civilians caught in the violence who got injured by the exploding pagers.

mlyiDsvStuM,"Haitian Voodoo Not to be confused with West African Vodun, Louisiana Voodoo, or Hoodoo (spirituality). Haitian Vodou[a] (/Ààvo äduÀê/) is an African diasporic religion that developed in Haiti between the 16th and 19th centuries. It arose through a process of syncretism between several traditional religions of West and Central Africa and Roman Catholicism. There is no central authority in control of the religion and much diversity exists among practitioners, who are known as Vodouists, Vodouisants, or Serviteurs. A sequined drapo flag, depicting the v√®v√® symbol of the lwa Loko Atison; these symbols play an important role in Vodou ritual Vodou teaches the existence of a transcendent creator divinity, Bondye, under whom are spirits known as lwa. Typically deriving their names and attributes from traditional West and Central African deities, they are equated with Roman Catholic saints. The lwa divide into different groups, the nanchon (""nations""), most notably the Rada and the Petwo, about whom various myths and stories are told. This theology has been labelled both monotheistic and polytheistic. An initiatory tradition, Vodouists commonly venerate the lwa at an ounf√≤ (temple), run by an oungan (priest) or manbo (priestess). Alternatively, Vodou is also practised within family groups or in secret societies like the Bizango. A central ritual involves practitioners drumming, singing, and dancing to encourage a lwa to possess one of their members and thus communicate with them. Offerings to the lwa, and to spirits of the dead, include fruit, liquor, and sacrificed animals. Several forms of divination are utilized to decipher messages from the lwa. Healing rituals and the preparation of herbal remedies and talismans also play a prominent role. Vodou developed among Afro-Haitian communities amid the Atlantic slave trade of the 16th to 19th centuries. Its structure arose from the blending of the traditional religions of those enslaved West and Central Africans brought to the island of Hispaniola, among them Kongo, Fon, and Yoruba. There, it absorbed influences from the culture of the French colonialists who controlled the colony of Saint-Domingue, most notably Roman Catholicism but also Freemasonry. Many Vodouists were involved in the Haitian Revolution of 1791 to 1801 which overthrew the French colonial government, abolished slavery, and transformed Saint-Domingue into the republic of Haiti. The Roman Catholic Church left for several decades following the Revolution, allowing Vodou to become Haiti's dominant religion. In the 20th century, growing emigration spread Vodou abroad. The late 20th century saw growing links between Vodou and related traditions in West Africa and the Americas, such as Cuban Santer√≠a and Brazilian Candombl√©, while some practitioners influenced by the N√©gritude movement have sought to remove Roman Catholic influences. Most Haitians practice both Vodou and Roman Catholicism, seeing no contradiction in pursuing the two different systems simultaneously.

Legal Definitions: In the U.S., abortion is defined as the termination of a pregnancy before the fetus is viable outside the womb, typically before 24 weeks. Once a baby is born, it is considered a person under the law, and any act to terminate its life would be classified as infanticide, which is illegal in all states. Botched Abortions: Instances of botched abortions can occur, particularly in cases where medical procedures are performed in unsafe conditions or by unqualified individuals. However, these are rare in legal settings where abortions are performed by licensed medical professionals. Complications from abortions, including those performed later in pregnancy, can lead to severe outcomes, but they do not equate to allowing a born infant to die",@Neptune_p_g,2024-09-13

If the CNN interview had gone well, then her campaign team would have some cover to say ""This is how she is when things get serious"", but trying to say she had any authenticity during the debate strains the suspension of disbelief too far. We can see the metaphorical puppet strings holding her up. Trump could have done better. He is terrible at defending himself against hoaxes. However, ABC broke its own debate rules and it was really him verses three people when he went in expecting to debate just Harris.

5pkCFvoaMwk,"The Adventist Home Chapter 82‚ÄîHow the Christian Chooses His Recreation Card Playing‚Äîa Prelude to Crime‚ÄîCard playing should be prohibited. The associations and tendencies are dangerous. The prince of the powers of darkness presides in the gaming room and wherever there is card playing. Evil angels are familiar guests in these places. There is nothing in such amusements beneficial to soul or body. There is nothing to strengthen the intellect, nothing to store it with valuable ideas for future use. The conversation is upon trivial and degrading subjects.... Expertness in handling cards will soon lead to a desire to put this knowledge and tact to some use for personal benefit. A small sum is staked, and then a larger, until a thirst for gaming is acquired, which leads to certain ruin. How many has this pernicious amusement led to every sinful practice, to poverty, to prison, to murder, and to the gallows! And yet many parents do not see the terrible gulf of ruin that is yawning for our youth.17 The Fear of Being Singular‚ÄîProfessed Christians who are superficial in character and religious experience are used by the tempter as his decoys. This class are always ready for the gatherings for pleasure or sport, and their influence attracts others. Young men and women who have tried to be Bible Christians are persuaded to join the party, and they are drawn into the ring. They do not prayerfully consult the divine standard to learn what Christ has said in regard to the fruit to be borne on the Christian tree. They do not discern that these entertainments are really Satan's banquet, prepared to keep souls from accepting the call to the marriage supper of the Lamb and preventing them from receiving the white robe of character, which is the righteousness of Christ. They become confused as to what it is right for them as Christians to do. They do not want to be thought singular, and naturally incline to follow the example of others. Thus they come under the influence of those who have never had the divine touch on heart or mind.18 Avoid the First Step Toward Indulgence‚ÄîYou may see no real danger in taking the first step in frivolity and pleasure seeking and think that when you desire to change your course, you will be able to do right as easily as before you yielded yourselves to do wrong. But this is a mistake. By the choice of evil companions many have been led step by step from the path of virtue into depths of disobedience and dissipation to which at one time they would have thought it impossible for them to sink.19 A Clear Declaration of Christian Principles‚ÄîIf you truly belong to Christ, you will have opportunities for witnessing for Him. You will be invited to attend places of amusement, and then it will be that you will have an opportunity to testify to your Lord. If you are true to Christ then, you will not try to form excuses for your nonattendance, but will plainly and modestly declare that you are a child of God, and your principles would not allow you to be in a place, even for one occasion, where you could not invite the presence of your Lord.20 It is God's purpose to manifest through His people the principles of His kingdom. That in life and character they may reveal these principles, He desires to separate them from the customs, habits, and practices of the world.... Wonderful scenes are opening before us; and at this time a living testimony is to be borne in the lives of God's professed people so that the world may see that in this age, when evil reigns on every side, there is yet a people who are laying aside their will and are seeking to do God's will‚Äîa people in whose hearts and lives God's law is written. God expects those who bear the name of Christ to represent Him. Their thoughts are to be pure, their words noble and uplifting. The religion of Christ is to be interwoven with all that they do and say....

5pkCFvoaMwk,"Regarding the notorious ‚Äúmock‚Äù of the Last Supper at the opening ceremony of the Olympics in Paris 2024. Why is there so much fuss about it? After seeing the show more attentively, I can say that it‚Äôs disputable when some people claim the show was offensive to Christianity. The catwalk show on one of the bridges looked rather ugly, but was it directly offensive to Christianity? Let‚Äôs be precise. First of all, I counted 16 people on both sides of that full-sized woman wearing a strange-looking russian-like hat. Around Jesus there were the 12 apostles, not 16, right? So, was it really a parody of the Last Supper? Should any group of 13 or more people standing in a row at a table be always considered as a mock of the Last Supper? Apart from that, even Leonardo showed some inaccuracy in his painting as it‚Äôs said in the Bible that Jesus and the apostles were reclining when taking food at the Last Supper, while in his painting we see them sitting and standing (see the texts of the Gospels of the Bible: ‚ÄúWhen evening came, Jesus was reclining at the table with the Twelve.‚Äù Matthew 26:20; ‚ÄúWhen the hour came, Jesus and his apostles reclined at the table.‚Äù Luke 22:14; ‚ÄúWhen evening came, Jesus arrived with the Twelve. While they were reclining at the table eating, he said‚Ä¶‚Äù Mark 14:17-18). Do you want to say that Leonardo didn‚Äôt read the Bible? He did. He was an artist and he pictured the scene in his own artistic way. It was traditional in Rome and other lands in those times to recline while dining, take food slowly and have talks while eating. Jesus and the apostles were not standing or sitting at the table, as you see in the texts of the Bible. And even if that chubby woman at the Olympics opening ceremony was meant to ‚Äúrepresent‚Äù Jesus, perhaps for the purpose of a mock it would have been better (from the mockers‚Äô point of view) to place there a bearded trans, wouldn‚Äôt it? The chubby woman didn‚Äôt look like Jesus at all. What was the slightest similarity? The people (drag queens or whatever you may call them) didn‚Äôt have any food or drinks on the table, so how on earth can it represent or mock any kind of supper? The Leonardo‚Äôs painting shows food and drinks on the table (though participants are not reclining). Supper means you eat and drink something and not just dance wearing drag clothes and work on some DJ effects unit. And were there any religious symbols or gestures at the catwalk show to say that it was a mock of religion? I think there was no offence of any religion. Or should we then consider the tradition of the Olympics offensive as it is completely mundane from the religious point of view? Let‚Äôs go the full way then, why only catwalk shows? And the Olympic Games originate in non-christian Greek tradition. Should they be banned then? Now, regarding some people saying, ‚Äúthe opening ceremony was so terrible that we aren‚Äôt gonna watch this Olympics at all.‚Äù Well, I saw the whole of the 4-hour opening ceremony on the Eurosport channel. The most of the things were just great, beautiful and elegant, like Paris itself. Yes, I agree there were some ugly things like that catwalk show, beheaded monarchs with streams of blood and perhaps a bit overdoing the LGBT stuff in certain episodes. But overall the ceremony was successful. The rest is just politics. How does it affect athletes who are hard-working guys and live just for sport achievements? You may or may not like certain parts of the opening ceremony in Paris, but sport is sport. If you are a sports fan you will watch the Olympics anyway. I‚Äôm not much into sports, but even I enjoy watching the Olympics and I‚Äôm cheering the athletes. It‚Äôs an important event for the planet. Just yesterday I couldn‚Äôt stop watching that extremely difficult men‚Äôs 272-km cycling race around Paris and the final triumph of Remco Evenepoel from Belgium. It was such a sport drama! I was charmed by the beauty of Paris (the Eurosport‚Äôs broadcast was just excellent!) and I was so elated to see thousands of joyful people cheering the cyclists in the streets of Paris (is there anything wrong with them that they came to see the sports?) And what about the French team of judo wrestlers competing with the Japanese team in the finals? You must see great Teddy Riner ending his sport career at this Olympics and again proving his amazing skills in the final sessions. The judo finals kept me on the edge of my seat, really. Thank you France for arranging these wonderful Olympics Games! It‚Äôs not easy at all, it takes a lot. But it's easy to condemn and find faults.",@s_nord2800,2024-08-04

At the center of the table is Apollo, while Dionysus does what he knows best: drinks, eats, and celebrates, even if he is not blue, like the one in the opening ceremony in Paris. And if Biljert‚Äôs technique reminds you of something from‚Ä¶ da Vinci, perhaps ‚Äúconfusing‚Äù many, the explanation is quite simple: the Dutch painter spent part of his life in Rome and, like many of his colleagues, was influenced by the art of Caravaggio (1571-1610).",@edwhug,2024-08-02

CoHb4oLoXSw,"Thanks for covering this tragedy which the Democrats tried to cover up, and DID most certainly cheat in my home state of GA. But the point everybody is missing about Joe, was explained by the Fox News chief Medical Reporter, AND President Trump's former Navy Surgeon General. The critically important information was that Joe is not only old and some dementia, but that it was a KNOWN SIDE EFFECT of the massive strokes called a brain aneurysm, which he suffered TWICE many decades ago, as a senator. One incident needed open brain surgery to save his life, which took him out of the Senate for 6 months, to recover!!! The chief Medical consultant from NYC on Fox News, who also lead the Disabled Vets Bike rides at the Bush ranch, clearly explained that the open surgery was soon replaced 2 years later, less invasive thru neck arteries, became available. Finally, to make my point, studies he referenced comparing the long-term outcomes definitely showed dementia and other symptoms seen in Biden, for over 4 years and the 06/27/2024 Debate we just witnessed!!! The results for him was it saved his life, but may well be why he should NoT have run in 2020.

Use it by keeping eyes on him and make the people grow in dispair seeing it and Trump nearing victory. Get the people in great dispair to desire hope to suddenly come. Thats when they will usher in Michelle. She wont play it as a politician but as a relatable strong black woman. She comes as a hero so she can bypass political headaches. Then if she won wont be obligated to traditional laws either. Let Joe stay and she runs against all of them. A Michelle in the lions den type of moment. People will love to see her be brave, strong, empowered all alone, going up against older white men all by herself. She can skip the whole vetting process just by Joe prolonging her entry by causing voters to daily watch him decline and grow in dispair. And when they think it's time, will get Michelle to come and appeal to women and all those who hate Trump, in addition to celebrities who just joined Trump. Many are not loyal and if it will benefit them supporting her they will..... Come at the last minute and she beomes a major threat. Will become new face of patriotism at that moment. Her not running as a politician would offer her race/ gender protections. Limits what can be said too. Therefore I think, they are enjoying people only thinking on terms of checkers, only watching out for the kings. But try to think in terms of chess instead. Same board but totally different game mentally and strategically. In chess, the queen can also make moves. So it will be very important to watch what she does.

CoHb4oLoXSw,"I, and every observant person on Earth, concur that Biden is unwell. I am a retired Nurse Practitioner who is very worried about our nation's safety and security with this man's thumb on the Big Red Button. I've become obsessed with the accelerating progression of his symptoms, and the ridiculous way his staff and family, and the liberal media, all think that if they pretend there is nothing wrong and claim he is more vigorous and vital than ever, then no one will notice what our ‚Äúlying‚Äù eyes are telling us. For a long time I too thought his diagnosis might be Alzheimer's. However, now I am leaning more toward Parkinson's because of his dramatic physical presentation. The symptoms of Parkinson's include: tremor, slowed movements, freezing, difficulty walking, rigid or stiff muscles, stooped posture, poor balance, loss of automatic movements (such as blinking or swinging your arms when you walk), speech changes (such as speaking softly or quickly, slurring, hesitating before talking, or monotone speech patterns), behavior changes (such as anger outbursts and irritability), and often, various levels and presentations of cognitive impairment. Biden clearly exhibits each and every symptom on this list, EXCEPT tremor, which is one of the main symptoms of Parkinson's. My theory is that he may have a tremor which has been controlled since it first showed up with careful dosing of Carbidopa/Levodopa, so it has never been noticed by the public. He DEFINITELY has slowness of movements, freezing, stiff gait, and stiff posture in general. He does not swing his arms when he walks, and when he freezes, he is holding his arms in an odd stiff way in front of his body. His speech is often very soft, and we've all seen him slur and garble phrases. The way he trips up stairs may be due to difficulty lifting his feet. And of course we've all witnessed his cognitive impairment and behavior changes. This is just my theory, based on my professional training and experience, and my ""lying‚Äù eyes. I feel strongly that Mr. Biden is a very vulnerable, feeble and ill man who, by being kept in his role as President all this time, is the victim of Elder Abuse by the Biden family. I reported them to Adult Protective Services of Delaware during the campaign season of 2020, to no effect, of course.

Maybe Elon should stop bashing employees who can't come to the office for 60-80 hrs a week and celebrate a PARENT TRACK so that highly educated professional moms who want to be home w/ young kids don't lose all of the investment and networking and have to start out as secretaries in their 40s, facing ageism and sexism to boot.

oa_9pihWTrs,"It's rather simple. I just heard, on an 'UnHerd' video, that there is discussions in the government of the UK around mis-information, etc. Most of it was about how the business models are about clicks and not truth, blah blah blah. Here's how true economists think: Let the dumb businesses chase clicks, if people want to be lied to, let them. The organizations that report the truth and do it in an unbiased way WILL ATTRACT THE TRUTH SEEKERS. Done. Maybe truth seekers aren't easily manipulated into clicking on links or paying for information... that's a different story, and something worth investigating. No matter what, I think it's a black eye to industries, like journalism, where lies bring more money. Lots of people want to be lied to apparently. It takes a strong character to want to SWIM alone in a sea of insanity. Still, that dim light will burn brightest among the darkness. It's a cycle that needs to be moved through, not suppressed or toyed with. Human nature changes slowly. Just look at how cultish people are acting after religious adherence decreased... we're still thinking supernaturally. I would rather know who the idiots are, and love them gently, and in personal situations, than to do something like ban their speech, or throw insults anonymously online. It's good that we have dissenting opinions. True DEI. It must be that so many people feel ineffectual from what they thought they would become (unrealistic expectations implanted by lies from parents?) That they take jobs and feel the NEED to change structures, and what not. I've always felt that the most praise should go to the administrative staff that keeps things working smoothly, not differently. Smooth transitions usually mean lower chance of praise, but WAY happier employees, etc. I think I'm going to go be gracious to some of those administrative staffers that probably don't know how much we rely on them NOT changing for the sake of change, or notoriety. Solutions can be both subtle, and work within a traditional framework. I should know, I'm still working with VERY old technology, and integrating those parts with newer parts.

HZ0lx8Dq4h4,"FOR SOME CLARITY!!! The stirring up hatred offence. Since 1986, there has been an offence of stirring up racial hatred. From 1st April 2024, a similar offence is being introduced in Scotland, to cover stirring up hatred on grounds of age, disability, religion, sexual orientation, transgender identity, or variations in sex characteristics (intersex). The offence of stirring up hatred on one of those grounds applies where someone behaves in a way that a reasonable person would consider to be threatening or abusive, and they deliberately intend their behaviour to stir up hatred. The law says it is not an offence if the behaviour was, in the particular circumstances of the case, reasonable. It also says that, when deciding whether the behaviour was reasonable, a court must bear in mind the right to freedom of expression, including that the right applies to expressions that offend, shock or disturb. The law also says that behaviour does not count as threatening or abusive solely because it involves discussion or criticism of matters relating to age, disability, sexual orientation, transgender identity or variations in sex characteristics. To be this offence, the behaviour must be specifically threatening or abusive (not just critical), and it must be done with the intention of stirring up hatred, and not be otherwise reasonable. To give an idea of what kinds of behaviour this might cover, in England there has been a similar offence covering sexual orientation for more than 10 years. A group of people were successfully prosecuted for that offence after they put leaflets through people‚Äôs front doors in an English city, calling for the death penalty for LGB people (and including a cartoon of a person being hanged. Now I can only assume that those who have raised concern about this bill (amendment) are either ignorant of the wording/meaning of it, or are scared/ worried about something in it. My view is that, I can't imagine that I'd ever do anything listed above, so it doesn't worry me. Why are so many people panicking about their freedom of speech? The above sets it all out very clearly. Can it be it's another opportunity to have a pop at Scottish government??? Sounds a bit too familiar !!",@tolor3254,2024-04-18

The lighting is also suboptimal, but it's okay for now (like try to get so motivated lighting and also some back light and also try to go for a key light that is 45¬∞ from the face instead of full frontal) oh and the cable of the lavalier mic goes to the inside of the jacket to hide it!

No matter how many normal guy things I was clicking on, liking, responding to, the reels seemed to be stuck in a theme where the woman was almost always scantily clad and always jiggling her front or back lol. All those reels/shorts were pretty lame and sad cause fully grown women who were moms themselves, were disrespecting themselves like that. Then I emailed FB and asked them why their algorithm kept showing me that garbage when they very well knew I am a married man. I asked them what was their intention in continuously showing and suggesting reels that showed scantily clad women; even after FB knew I was married. FB never replied.

The research she cites at <a href="" is not referring to TickTock videos, but things like answering questions in a bikini verses a sweater. Note that she also cites no data regarding who is Liking videos. Often the Likes come from other females, which is a fact that feminists absolutely hate and so ignore.

aq7t0vHIuU8,"The fault lies with the pseudo-liberalization of society and the demonization of conservatives. Feminists purposely helped create much of this present deeply disturbed society we now have because they thought destroying the Alpha males was a smart idea. (nowadays real men watch from the sidelines shaking their heads but have been stripped of the power to stop the insanity). Once the Alpha Males were demonized the fiber that built our society began to fall apart so liberals got what they asked for. In my lifetime I witnessed the growth of modern feminism alongside the radical attacks on the social or political rules and laws of society by brainwashed Left-Wing radicals. I knew who the fanatical women and the radicals were because I remember them in school and in the community. They were always the lazy losers, the unpopular outsiders, never the Alpha males & females. They were the jerks and creeps that cheated on tests, who few people liked and who were always trying to rip off the system for their own gain through manipulation and lies. The loud ugly angry feminists were never the attractive, popular girls or women because those women were quite happy with their power back then but did want a few needed changes. It wasn't a natural progression of society like in the past but we didn't realize this until about 1992. In the 1950's Russia, then the Communist Soviet Union, realized they could never conquer the democracies by force so began a massive programme using spies to blend into western society and gradually bring about extreme social such discontent so it would fall apart from within. My parents were traditional liberals, but my mother was in the WWII spy organization, the BSC, so suspected what was happening as did my War veteran father. They said society needed changes but not by destroying the existing power structure or anarchy would take over, the most terrifying of realities. Even as a boy I could tell the radicals were not the winners of society and never had the same respect for them as I did for people who were more conservative than us. However, none of us were aware of the extent of the Sleeper Spies until it was proven after the fall of the Soviet Union, in the early 1990's, when thousands of files were made public from the Russian Secret Service, The KGB. Meantime beginning in the 1980's in America and 1990's in Canada the conservative parties began to be taken over by Far-Right Wing Christian fanatics who brushed aside logic and science for their delusional approach to life.

That would be my idea of having a great kid/parent relationship and keeping adults active in physical activities like softball leagues, so their kids can watch them and cheer wholesome community building activity. For those not athletic. Just imagine how much better shape you would be in if you participated and the score wasn't important. You'd still be running the bases, or outfield. Heck, bake some goods for your team. The good parts of yester-year. Bring back wholesome communities and the internet will fade back to how it was intended, for information exchange and the betterment movement.

Napster had hardcore child porn disguised as songs and albums... that was 25 years ago. Parents are lazy. Another thing to mention is that girls are sexually curious and active at young ages. So parents need to learn how to deal with that. One of my old friends said she started masturbating at age 4 and she really liked doing it. She wasn't molested or groomed, she discovered it on her own. And stuff like that is more common than you'd think. So I agree that TikTok is evil, but it's not the origin of the issue, just an avenue of expression. Here's an idea, go to Church as a family. Read the Bible as a family. Pray together, as a family. Everyone, and I mean everyone nowadays are complete narcissists. That's the real problem. People are beyond the point of self obsession. They don't care about their kids or the suffering of others.

Religion used to be the meeting house that the community came to face to face and all agreed upon the same norms and even if there were those who might desire to leave those norms, would be rejected by society for that. Look back at history and you will see the hedonism rise with the demise of the church, and you will also see a sharp drop in the church with the huge rise in the use of the internet and it's ability to rapidly share information. The internet killed the mangod. If you listen to Jordan Petersons lectures on the subject; killing mangod before the invent of a new one is a big no no. Luckily we can do one better than a mangod; we can be morally just and nondogmatic. We can argue our points like the justice system and vote on it like we do to elect our representatives.

aq7t0vHIuU8,"From a security pro, this is a good video and desperately needed advice to parents and kids! We minimized ALL screen time as a normal family lifestyle, but even more conscientiously after our daughter was born. We didn't have TV, though we would rent or buy movies. Instead, we read books individually and to each other. (I'm talking about reading BOOKS like the LOTR trilogy or The Man In The Iron Mask out loud.) She got her first electronic device of any kind (no game consoles, no TV of her own, etc.) in the 4th grade. That phone was a dumb flip phone - phone calls and painful (using the phone keyboard) SMS only. This helped her to remain an avid reader, diligent student, and play a lot of school sports. We also used those years to educate her about social media, social politeness (people in the same room ALWAYS come first for attention and conversation), the permanence of the Internet and what that implies, cyber bullying and scams, etc. In the 8th grade, she got a Chromebook along with a LOT more instructions and warnings. I think she got her first low-IQ smart phone in ninth or tenth grade. We reserved the right to ask her to unlock it and hand it over at any time, but she never gave us cause to exercise that right. For the most part, her social media activity has been minimal and appropriate. She worked to pay her own way through college, and she is working on her doctorate in biomedical sciences now. My experience is that it isn't just about denying access to devices until an appropriate age. Besides deep resentment, that can lead to college freshman syndrome, where sudden freedom without self discipline leads to many tragic mistakes. Instead, it is about lots of love and education, and about how to get the most out of the power of technology without letting it (or others) use you.

aq7t0vHIuU8,"I think cell phones should never be given to kids until they're of drivers license age, and social media blocked until age 18 once they do get them. I also believe that as advanced technology is these days, it shouldn't be that hard to completely remove the ability to delete your history on a device, that way parents can check what their kids have been doing on their devices. Maybe set the history to auto delete after a period of time, say, a couple of months, but not allow the user to delete it themselves. This way the history remains for a while but won't fill up your storage space over time. Politically shutting down social media would be the better option, but we all know that'll never happen. Kids need to learn to live life the way everyone did before social media was invented. More importantly, they need Jesus Christ in their lives at a young age before they grow up. Social media is another tool used by grown people to indoctrinate kids. It's not happening just at school only. Facebook being the worst of them all due to private groups. That was where I myself was indoctrinated into the trans filth. But I got the mental help I needed to get over that, and every single one of those people who indoctrinated me, quickly turned on me at the 1st wiff of doubt. Thus proving that they were never friends. I thank God Almighty that I never turned gay thru that whole ordeal that I endured. And I thank God Almighty even more that I never started taking hormones or had any surgeries. I'm a man, born and bred. I'm not a female. I was delusional the entire time and had no clue of the path I was headed down except for this gut feeling that I never understood. If I can get better and heal from it, anyone can. I'm very happy that I understand those gut feelings I had back then. I'm also very happy that I see clearly now and have rid myself of that mental illness I struggled with for so many years of my life. Sadly, I live with a pedophile in the next room over not 10 feet away who runs a music promoting channel on X, the majority of his clients being underage females, or were when he met them. So I currently struggle with evil thoughts towards him. Not many days go by that I don't wanna bust in, tie him down, and start chopping his naughty bits off. Lucky for him, I have Jesus to keep me at bay. Jesus is the ONLY person keeping me in check in that regard. Before I became a Christian, I was very sociopathic and evil to the core. Those thoughts still creep in now and then, but they no longer control me as they once did. Again, I have God Almighty to thank for that, and for giving me the power to resist temptation and overcome my evil desires. My brother would be gone right now if I hadn't turned to Jesus. I got delivered and saved. Moral of the story: I'm living proof of what social media ""could"" turn someone into, and succeeds in some cases. Gladly I'm no longer one of those evil success stories. I'm a biological man who follows the Lord Jesus Christ, and I've never been happier in my life, regardless of the backlash that ignorant people throw out about Christianity these days. None of this means I still won't go postal if I absolutely have to. I have zero problem being a warrior for God if need be, but only towards evil people. You could say I'm like a real life Dexter and I would agree with it. The bible teaches us to love one another, but also teaches us to hate evil and stand our ground.

She had posted a couple of videos that were short one day and gave a bunch of private info out in one of the videos that could bring predators to her school or home. We made her remove the videos and delete her channel. She had the channel for a total of 17 hours. Now she understands that we as parents aren‚Äôt going to allow free reign on the internet. It is up to us as parents to control this stuff until she turns 18.

aq7t0vHIuU8,"This didn't just suddenly start with social media. Sexualizing kids started in the late 90's. With child beauty pageants. In the early 1970's my sister entered my niece into beauty pageants. Back then they were not allowed to use makeup on the little girls. All the could do was fix their hair with curls or whatever. The young girls would only ware a frilly dress. There were no swimsuit or tight sexy dresses worn. In the late early 1990's that all changed. That's when they added little girls modeling swimsuits and sexy adult types evening dresses. Look at the pictures of girls in pageants in the 70's, compared to the pictures of say Jonbenet Ramsey in the 90's. That little girl was completely sexualized. It became acceptable to sexualize young girls because of that change. Young girls see this as sexualizing young girls in on TV, in movies and advertising is the norm now.

aq7t0vHIuU8,"This leads to a bigger issue though. Because social media isn't some ""mysterious witch in the woods."" It's literally just giving them access to people around them in society. So maybe we should start thinking about WHY social media is such a big issue in society. I'll give you a hint, it's not actually social media that's the problem. Society is the problem, social media is just a representation of that society. . It's much easier to blame social media than to blame the majority of society. But that is truly our problem right now. Society in itself protects people, which removes natural selection from the equation. For me to die would literally require serious effort. If I go out and get hit by a bus, the hospital is going to save me with or without my consent... If I eat my health away and become 500 pounds. I just get liposuction and now I'm healthy again...

aq7t0vHIuU8,"This lady had her boyfriend stolen üòÖ The constant fear mongers on this topic is disturbing. The victimological model tends to portray male figures as potential threats or perpetrators, which can reinforce harmful stereotypes and biases. By emphasizing children as victims, it inadvertently fosters an environment where toxic masculinity rhetoric becomes more prevalent. The characterization of all adult-child sexual interactions as inherently harmful can contribute to a perception that men, in particular, are prone to sexual predation. In this context, discussions surrounding toxic masculinity may perpetuate the fear and distrust of men, impacting how society views childhood sexuality, gender identity, and relationships. By challenging the victimological model's oversimplified approach, we can also question how it intersects with toxic masculinity rhetoric and whether this rhetoric is influenced by misinformation and fear associated with childhood sexuality. It's essential to explore how these two phenomena interact and how they collectively affect public perceptions, policies, and attitudes toward men, children, and the broader discourse surrounding these complex issues. By acknowledging the capacity of children to understand and engage with their own sexuality responsibly, society can transcend the limitations of the victimological model and work towards a more balanced, informed, and responsible approach that considers the complexities of childhood sexuality, toxic masculinity, and their interplay.",@Sir-.-,2024-03-07

aq7t0vHIuU8,"Can parents justify imposing restraints on the behavior of children anymore without appearing arbitrary even hateful joy killers? Currently in nearly all widely discussed issues, no outside authority is cited or respected. But when a group (tribe, club, nation) agrees on a moral standard, argumentation and natural decline in values is inhibited having been satisfied. U.S. history shows that to be the case. We were founded by religious (Biblical - Christian) leaders and got off the rails (sort of like today) after many years but were saved by return to them by means of several revivals the last of which was in the 19th century. That was enough that large evangelistic crusades were well-attended and effective in bringing people to God's values and consequent values to those organizations in which they served. Today, the size and influence of the rebellious population is such that evangelism is heavily criticized, mocked or even restricted by influential leaders so that crusades in this country are not even fairly reported by most of the media. The negative effects on the entirety of our society are such that no political or religious group is capable of restoring the divinely created standards required for a happy, successfully society. Depression, purposeless and death by murder or suicide are increasing and will continue to do so except in the lives of those who recognize and own their debauched state and turn to the only one who can deliver them from it. ‚òù""He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness"", St. John to the believers in Israel (sustains hope for believers) and ""Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved ..."" saves from certain death first from Earth and then from God. - St. Paul, the apostle.

I don't think he would suppose there would be a soul left alive in the strip, were that the case. The munitions would be different magnitudes within the numbers. Mr. Lowry, National Review only intends to not serve actual journalistic coverage of what's happening in several critical respects. It only debases NR beyond hypocrisy it must abide for itself to attack actual journalism happening. I know you're under the gun to throw mud. Better to be silent than to impugn yourselves and the reality of America's corruption into this lack of a free-from-cartel-control press. Fact is that is transparently Israeli policy, as has been in place for years, to wage appalling 20X+ or far greater proportionality. (Whatever number you want to put on it.) One could honestly present the lopsided ratio with the pride, but not trying to obscure the disproportionality is not pursuing higher ground as a journalist. The stating of the concept of ""Gaza is Hamas"" is a polemic creed for the elimination of a Palestinian Gaza as any mass distinguised from the Israeli regime. This elimination of the other doctrine does not lack comparison with core-belief genocidality celebrating Jericho. Indeed, it is direct continuation of that doctrine of genocidality and goyim. Palestinian-life-disproportionality is long established overt policy, leveraged in the context of the official denunciation by Israel of the ""two-state"" policy and the rejection of the Kerry-Griswold-alia ""international rights to Jerusalem.""",@dbnst,2024-01-18

Harvard academic standards have been shown to be nothing but a farce in the light of their blatant disregard of Gay‚Äôs countless crimes of plagiarism and other forms of literary theft. The fact that Harvard allowed her to resign after her pathetic performance in the congressional hearings in which she verbally expressed the utter racism and hatred for all Jewish people everywhere from the depths of her very soul, and finally, when her countless crimes of plagiarism and other forms of out-right intellectual theft were found to be out in the open, where anyone who really cared could have found them at any time, had she been a white, heterosexual man, she would have been immediately fired.

Harvard has been shown to be an academic joke, and so, C.Gays crimes against academic integrity and anti-Semitic racial Justice become Harvards crimes. The fact that many of Harvard‚Äôs alumni donors have been alerted to Harvard‚Äôs crimes, is both welcomed, and applauded. It is clear that Harvard no longer strives for racial justice, nor do they foster academic excellence, what Harvard still cares about is the almighty dollar.

No gut feelings, each and every impression must be rationalized according to the four point rubric. Companies also train their employees to detect inherent bias, mostly in themselves. The reasoning is very simple, people with biases harm the company by creating conflicts within the organization, as well as miss opportunities to hire great candidates.

And before some troll says, ""Oh, the chosen whine about it"" or ""They should get over feeling themselves so special"" I'll remind you that those same trolls are the ones complaining about wars on Christmas and feeling persecuted, not understanding that Christianity has been the dominant religion in N. America and that ain't going to change anytime soon. So, people like that can shut up and GTFO...they're hypocrites of the worst order. Gay's charges of racism are also BS. She was hired and promoted by (mainly) white interests in her school. They knew she wasn't cutting the mustard, academically speaking, but they let her go on because if they had said something, she'd have screamed racism at every opportunity. Now, she'll probably still scream it, except as a professor and not a president...and she's still making the same salary. I'm all for diversity and inclusion, and if someone deserves a job it should be because they merit it, not because of their skin color. Harvard seems to have forgotten that. That concept isn't racist; it's being honest. TL: DR...Gay messed up, lied, and paid for her sins by being demoted when she should've been fired, IMO. Have a nice day.",@jessfrankel5212,2024-01-12

I do not support former President Trump's removal from the ballot, but do worry about media manipulation of emotion. When assessing the importance of an instance of treason the odds of success are relevant; the odds of success of the January 6 rioters, while extremely low, far exceed those of the clownish Ms. Yazzie. The coming election has real issues for all of us to base our vote on; I hope, for myself and for all Americans, to avoid having the next 10 months be 10 months of being manipulated towards anger.",@anthonygraybosch2202,2024-01-07

kXwYqEda6uM,"I like how the mayor of Chicago and New York say consequences for bus companies if they dont ask people/customers for their papers/immigration status, but no consequences for people crossing our border illegally. SHEESH! üôÑ What about what is humanatarian for American citizens and legal residents? They are importing in more people than there are jobs. It hurts the poor by putting downward pressure on already low wages.... An example . . . McDonald's in my hometown starts people off at about $10-$11 an hour. If they were allowed to hire all non legal immigrants (or even legal immigrants) who are willing to work for $7.25 minimum wage, they would. It would put a lot of citizens and legal residents out of a job and set a new baseline of pay to $7.25 and hour instead of $10-$11. That is why we have a limit on immigration numbers. To protect citizens. Mayor adams says ""we're saying between a certain period of time you are allowed to drop off migrants in the city, but youre going to do it at the location we specify so we dont over tax our resources, our man power and create a disorderly environment."" That sounds like it should be a national policy ... like. Um, I dont know . . . Go through our legal ports of entry (""a place we specify"") and stop crossing our border illegally so ""we dont over tax our resources, our man power and create a disorderly environment."" ü´°üôÑ Mayor adams and chicago mayor are saying, 'if you dont do it our way, it's illegal and well fine you.'
