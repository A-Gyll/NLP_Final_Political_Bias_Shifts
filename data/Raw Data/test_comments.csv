9CA_Q6fxgYg,"The Parasitic main stream media.<br>When the host of these so called news networks compare a newly elected President,  to men like  Putin, kim jung un and Xi Jinping, they are insulting and betraying the American people, their flag and their constitution.These radical irresponsible parasites feeding off their President and injecting poison into the hearts and minds of Americans, daily, is wrong and I believe pure evil. Their thirst for a story, a head line , no matter what the facts, is destroying this once great land.  Instead of uniting the people at this time, they are already busy dividing. I am sure, they must be giggling constantly, as they check the balance on their over grown fluffy bank accounts. But somewhere,  a young child is listening to them and he or she is staring at their new President through their eyes, and listening through their ears, and the sad reality is, they will continue to do this now,  for the next four years.  slowly chipping away , each day,  at the greatest country on this planet. These same networks have attempted to butcher this wonderful man and his family for eight years now, constantly feeding on their pain and suffering. Imagine what the United States Of America would look like today, if they had to support this man the first day he came down that escalator.  I believe the American people have been duped and they should start asking the question , why, do they keep doing it, who is really behind it. All my opinion of course.

Ui-fm3g_MPo,"For Trump, the first enemy is China. All the fuss around Ukraine is a &quot;storm in a teacup.&quot; The United States is the only beneficiary of this conflict. American gas has replaced Russian gas in Europe. Trump will blackmail Europe with the threat of Russia and force it to join the trade war with China. The closer Russian tanks are to the European borders, the more obedient Europe will be. At the same time, Trump plans to increase oil and gas production, and cancel all the restrictions of the Biden administration. But this means that prices will collapse. Last month, there was an estimate that the cost of shale oil was about $ 50. It is obvious that if prices collapse, the shale producers themselves will suffer. There is a point in increasing production only if the price remains the same as now. Under what scenario is this possible? Only under the condition of agreements with Saudi Arabia on a joint division of the share of oil exports of Russia and Iran by establishing a blockade of Iran and part of Russian exports. In this case, it is enough to give the Ukrainians the green light and drones will strike Novorossiysk and other oil terminals.  Biden had previously prohibited this. In this case, almost 4 million bpd (3 million bpd of Russian oil and 1 million bpd of Iranian oil) will be fairly divided between the US and the Saudis. This is at current prices, $120-150 billion in revenues that will flow from Russia and Iran to the US and the Saudis. Thus, Iran&#39;s nuclear program will be stopped, funding for Hezbollah and other proxies will cease, which is also beneficial to Israel. Let me remind you who is not in the know, Biden could not agree with the Saudis because Crown Prince Salman killed journalist Khashoggi in Turkey in the building of the Saudi Arabian embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was stuffed with wiretaps by the Turkish secret services and there is a full audio recording of the murder. At the same time, we must remember that King Abdullah had previously expelled Khashoggi precisely because he accused Donald Trump and spoiled relations between the Saudis and the US. That is, the scenario of a smoldering conflict is more beneficial to the US than ever.  In turn, the trade war with China will lead to a decrease in China&#39;s overall need for oil and gas, including from Russia. For the US, it is the income from gas and oil that can become the buffer that will allow taxes to be reduced under Trump&#39;s plan. And if I came up with a win-win option for the US and the Saudis, then their local strategists have long since come up with everything and are just waiting for January 25. This is precisely why Prince Salman did not come to the BRICS summit in Kazan. He was waiting for the US elections. By the way, the Saudis also desperately need money; they have not been able to balance their budget for the second year.",@Alexanderdnepr,2024-11-10 11:18:25+00:00

Restore Presidential Authority: Reissue the 2020 executive order to allow the president to remove rogue bureaucrats and use this power aggressively.<br><br>2. Clean Out Corrupt Actors: Overhaul the national security and intelligence agencies to remove corrupt actors and ensure faceless bureaucrats cannot target conservatives or political enemies.<br><br>3. Reform FISA Courts: Completely reform the FISA courts, addressing the issue of judges ignoring inaccuracies and abuses in warrant applications.<br><br>4. Truth and Reconciliation Commission: Establish a commission to declassify and publish documents related to Deep State spying, censorship, and corruption.<br><br>5. Crackdown on Government Leakers: Launch a major crackdown on government leakers collaborating with fake news media to spread false narratives, pressing criminal charges when possible.<br><br>6. Independent Inspectors General: Make every inspector general&#39;s office independent and physically separated from the departments they oversee.<br><br>7. Independent Auditing System: Ask Congress to create an independent auditing system to continually monitor intelligence agencies, ensuring they do not spy on citizens or run disinformation campaigns.<br><br>8. Relocate Federal Bureaucracy: Continue efforts to move federal bureaucracy to new locations outside of Washington, D.C., relocating up to 100,000 government positions.<br><br>9. Ban Federal Bureaucrat-to-Industry Jobs: Ban federal bureaucrats from taking jobs at companies they regulated while in office to prevent conflicts of interest.<br><br>10. Impose Congressional Term Limits: Push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress.<br><br>These objectives are aimed at dismantling entrenched bureaucracy, restoring transparency, and ensuring government accountability to the American people.",@inventamus,2024-11-09 13:27:15+00:00

Ui-fm3g_MPo,"The Parasitic main stream media, is destroying the greatest country on our planet and In my opinion, it is very intentional. <br>When the host of these so called news networks compare a newly elected President,  to men like  Putin, kim jung un and Xi Jinping, they are insulting and betraying the American people, their flag and their constitution. These people are parasites feeding off their President and injecting poison into the hearts and minds of Americans. Their thirst for a story, a head line , no matter what the facts, is destroying this once great land.  Instead of uniting the people at this time, they are already busy at dividing. I am sure, the puppets are giggling all the way to the bank, But somewhere,  a young child is listening to these people and he or she is staring at their new President through their eyes, and listening through their ears. The sad reality is, they will continue on this journey now for the next four years.  They have failed this time to take down this great country. These same networks have attempted to butcher a wonderful man and his family.  For eight years they have desperately tried to stop him. Imagine what the United States Of America would look like today, if they had to support this man the first day he came down that escalator.  I believe the American people have been duped by great powers far from their shores and they should be asking the question , who is really behind all of this mess, this is not the United States Of America as we knew it and they will not stop‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶All my opinion of course.

I think if we focus on local government and work together to build safer, stronger communities, we will withstand the tide of tyranny that is coming down the pike from Trump and his cronies.  Research shows that Trump&#39;s tax and deportation plans will only serve to hurt the US most vulnerable populations.  The rich will withstand the offense [except when it comes to income gained from the stock market] as you have resources to buffer the insults unlike those that are living paycheck to paycheck.

vA894m0sYCo,"Just posing this question. Was anyone confused by Trump&#39;s lax attitude when asked if he would accept the results? Being that he has spent the past 9 years whining about the election being rigged, i would have thought he would have mentioned it once again. And during the rally at Madison Square Gardens, his comment about having a &quot;little surprise&quot;.  Didn&#39;t that hit anyone&#39;s red flag? Also, if you think about it, Having Elon Musk, one of the wealthiest men on earth with almost infinite access to technology, how far fetched would it be for him to get a ballot machine and figure out how it works to understand how it could be manipulated? Or at least have someone in the U.S&gt; or Russia as there seem to be somer friendships there. Also, isn&#39;t anyone disturbed by how quick the counts went and the overwhelming amount of votes despite what we saw for numbers during Harris&#39; rallys? Do people REALLY think women would come out in droves to vote against their best interest? And why was it over so fast!!? For such a consequential historical event, why are we satisfied with a defeat that took only hours?? There is something not right here, and trhe American people are far too lax and passive for the implications of what&#39;s to come.

All of the problems and issues Californians are dealing with and this is Prima-Donna golden boy Newsom and the Democrats focus. Spending all of their time and tax payer money trying to appease small woke special interest groups against Trump. Either you are following the laws of this country or you are breaking them. Doesn&#39;t matter that you&#39;re a Governor or the AG and if you are breaking them then you need to be held accountable. Democrats still haven&#39;t come to the realization of go woke, go broke and also lose elections. On immigration, well that&#39;s a federal issue. You are in this country either legally or illegally. Just because you decided to call yourself a sanctuary city or state doesn&#39;t make illegal folks legal. If you don&#39;t cooperate then Trump can cut your funding, and if the decision reaches the mostly conservative Supreme Court, they will probably rule in his favor. Then there is the possibility that if both houses of Congress are under GOP control, that they will introduce a bill and pass a law outlawing sanctuary cities and states out right. Then what is Newsom, Bonta and the other Democrat politicians claiming that their municipalities are sanctuaries for people in the U.S. illegally going to do? Defy the law? Then it won&#39;t only be a matter of cutting off federal funding, Trump can have the DOJ actually go in and press charges. I mean who do these people think they are?
